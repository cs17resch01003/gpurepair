\section{Benchmark Summary}
For experiments, a total of $752$ kernels ($266$ CUDA and $486$ OpenCL) were considered. This benchmark set is a union of four independent test suites and publicly available \cite{cudatoolkit} sample programs. The source data used to generate this report is available in the $\MB{generated}$ and $\MB{analysis}$ directories. \tableref{benchmark_summary} summarizes the various sources of the kernels.
