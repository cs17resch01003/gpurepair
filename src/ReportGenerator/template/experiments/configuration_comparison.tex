\section{Configuration Comparison}

\tool provides the option of disabling instrumentation of grid-level barriers and disabling inspection of programmer inserted barriers. Disabling these configuration have a significant performance impact. By default both these options are enabled. These configuration options are used to repair all the $@@kernel_count@@$ kernels from \tableref{benchmark_summary}. \tableref{configuration_comparison} summarizes the metrics of the various configurations.

\input{tables/configuration_comparison}

\tableref{configuration_comparison_autosync} summarizes the metrics of these configurations along with \autosync for the valid kernels.
