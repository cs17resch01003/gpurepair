\section{Configuration Comparison}

\tool provides the option of disabling instrumentation of grid-level barriers and disabling inspection of programmer inserted barriers. Disabling these configuration have a significant performance impact. By default both these options are enabled. 

The default instrumentation mechanism is to insert Assume statements for the barrier variables. An alternative approach for instrumentation is to use Axioms instead of the Assume statements. Invariant generation happens differently in both the instrumentation approaches.

The initial version of \tool used a Boogie program as a repair candidate and sent that to \verifier for verification. The newer version takes an incremental solving approach where the SMT expression generated by \verifier is used to generate repair candidates, and \zth is used to identify verification errors.

These configuration options are used to repair all the $@@kernel_count@@$ kernels from \tableref{benchmark_summary}. \tableref{configuration_comparison} summarizes the metrics of the various configurations.

\tableref{configuration_comparison_autosync} summarizes the metrics of these configurations along with \autosync for the valid kernels.
