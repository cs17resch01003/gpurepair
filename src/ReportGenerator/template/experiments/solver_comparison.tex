\section{Solver Comparison}

Besides the $mhs$ implementation of \tool, we introduce two more implementations of \tool, which use $MaxSAT$ and $SAT$ solvers, respectively, to solve the clauses. These implementations of \tool are used to repair all the $@@kernel_count@@$ kernels from \tableref{benchmark_summary}. \figref{mhs_maxsat} and \figref{mhs_sat} show the time comparison between these solvers.
