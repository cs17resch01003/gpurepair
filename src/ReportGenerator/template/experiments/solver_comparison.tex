\section{Solver Comparison}

Besides the $mhs$ implementation of \tool, we introduce the $MaxSAT$ implementation of \tool. These implementations of \tool are used to repair all the $@@kernel_count@@$ kernels from \tableref{benchmark_summary}. \figref{mhs_maxsat} shows the time comparison between these solvers.
